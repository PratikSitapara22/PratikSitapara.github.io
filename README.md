## Work & Projects

### **Master Thesis - Evaluation and Monitoring RAG for Enhanced Performance in Commercial Applications**

- Conducted comprehensive **evaluation of RAG systems** using information retrieval, reference-based, and reference-free metrics.
- Developed a **real-time monitoring tool** with LangSmith, optimizing performance by tracking **latency, accuracy, and tracing responses**.
- Built a **custom Python & Streamlit tool** to evaluate retrieval components, automating **embedding model selection** and streamlining the RAG optimization process.

#### **Thesis Abstract**

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at handling new data without retraining but suffer from factual inaccuracies and hallucinations. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** integrates external knowledge to improve accuracy. Over 60% of companies now incorporate RAG into their workflows. This study explores **state-of-the-art evaluation metrics** to assess Natural Language Generation (NLG) in RAG systems, using traditional IR metrics and both reference-based and reference-free evaluations. The findings highlight the importance of IR metrics in assessing retrieval quality and demonstrate that **reference-free metrics strongly correlate with human evaluations**, making them a reliable tool for RAG assessment. This research provides **practical insights for optimizing and evaluating RAG in enterprise applications**.
